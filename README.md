Memory Game Project.

What is the Memory Game?

This is a game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons or words.

Challenge:

Match cards in less time with less moves.

Instructions:

1-Click on a card.

2-Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remember each Card Place.

3-Match cards properly with less moves as you can and in faster time, The faster you do the higer score you get.

How I built the Game:

Created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed.
Created a counter that count the number of moves made by the player and timer to know his Score time.
Created a modal when the player wins shows his number of moves and time and stars rate.
Game reset when the player press the reset button.
Game reset when player press Play Again button.
